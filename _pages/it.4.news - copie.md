An individual himself/herself may file for bankruptcy, or a creditor, or an authorized body may petition for him/her to be declared bankrupt. It is mandatory to introduce the procedure for restructuring an individual’s debt if a court recognizes the application for declaring an individual bankrupt as justified. The court imposes the procedure for disposing of an individual’s property if such an individual has been declared bankrupt (for example, if the plan for restructuring the individual’s debt was not submitted within the prescribed period or it was not approved by the creditor’s meeting). The court may also temporarily restrict the right of the bankrupt individual to leave the Russian Federation.  [>>>](https://tbplaw.com/en/News/Russian_President_signed_a_bill_on_personal_bankruptcy_which_enacts_rehabilitation_procedures_for_debtors "Russian President signed a bill on personal bankruptcy which enacts rehabilitation procedures for debtors")

Ural-Invest controlled by former Bashneft CEO Ural Rakhimov is specified as a defendant in the action. The government of the Bashkortostan region controlled Bashneft until 2003\. Afterwards companies affiliated with Ural Rakhimov, son of the former head of Bashkortostan Murtaza Rakhimov, acquired  a major stake in Bashneft. The company was privatized in 2009 when Russian oil-to-telecoms conglomerate AFK Sistema acquired control of it.  [>>>](https://tbplaw.com/en/News/AFK_Sistema_holding_company_has_asserted_a_claim_to_Moscow_Arbitration_court_asking_damages_about_70_7_billion_rubles_for_forfeiture_of_Bashneft_share "AFK Sistema holding company has asserted a claim to Moscow Arbitration court asking damages about 70.7 billion rubles for forfeiture of Bashneft shares")
