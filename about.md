**Timofeev, Vahrenwald & Partners** is a full-service **Moscow law firm**. Our attorneys are admitted to practice law in the Russian Federation, and speak **Russian, English, French, German, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and Italian**.

TV&P law firm guarantees the high-quality legal skills that clients demand from large, multinational law firms, but with the **personal attention, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness** of a smaller, more intimate, law firm. The lawyers at TV&P are all members of the Moscow Bar and some of them, members of foreign Bars. Contrary to the current trend, TV&P has chosen to remain independent, and to preserve a concentrated and accessible structure, with a view to provide its clients and partners **with an efficient, personalised and trustworthy service**. Meanwhile, TV&P **has developed solid and privileged relations with an important number of law firms abroad**.

TV&P provides its clients with useful legal advice on all their commercial projects, the negotiating and drafting of their contracts, their relations with their employees or sub-contractors, and, if required, protects their interests before the Courts.

**Our legal representation is founded upon solid experience in our areas of practice** (lawyers successfully participated in a variety of projects, including $US 120 million debt recovery in LCIA, legal support for LNG supplies from Russia to USA by sea; bankruptcy of $US 40 million plant; legal support for the operations of medium-sized Russian oil and gas companies; legal counsel to a major South Korean investment fund on various aspects of operations in the Russian market, etc.).

Our lawyers provide **affordable, quality legal services** and personal attention **to small and large businesses**. We invite you to contact us by telephone or e-mail to get more information about our lawyers and practice areas. TV&P also provides **legal advice** and services for our individual clients in their day-to-day affairs.

We believe in an old-school concept of legal service, treating each client’s legal issues, whether business or personal, as central to that client’s well being and requiring the full attention of a partner. Our attorneys exercise the highest level of judgment, discretion and integrity in resolving client matters, regardless of the issue. **We may rely on strengths of our legal experts**. Among them well-known Russian lawyers, involved in law-making process and administration of justice, professors at world-renowned Russian universities (Moscow State Lomonosov University, Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Institute of State and Law of the Academy of Sciences of the Russian Federation).

We routinely confer with our clients at every stage of the legal process and believe that regular contact with our clients is a vital part of our responsibility to them. We are able negotiators and business advisors, but when necessary, we fight zealously and aggressively on our clients’ behalf.

We recognize that the cost of legal representation can inhibit a client’s ability to pursue his or her rights; accordingly, we are dedicated to **finding** innovative, **cost-effective solutions** to complex problems.
