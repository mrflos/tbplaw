    As of December 26, the oil-to-telecoms conglomerate Sistema has filed an action against Ural Invest, a company associated with Ural Rakhimov. It seeks compensation from Bashneft’s previous owners for the damages it allegedly incurred due to the confiscation of its stake in the oil company. The action was brought to Moscow Arbitration court after the court’s decision to restore state ownership in Bashneft shares entered into force. “We consider the claim to be ungrounded,” Rakhimov’s lawyer Sergei Makarenko said. Besides, he added that the commercial court’s decision has no prejudicial force for Ural Invest, which was not party to the Bashneft action. The lawyer said that due to the fact that Sistema did not file action against Bashneft, it cannot refer to the court’s ruling on the return of the Bashneft stake to the government as laid out in its claim. Makarenko also said that the Ural Invest accounts that were seized in October 2014 are still under arrest. Sistema acquired 71 percent of Bashneft shares from Ural Invest, a group of companies associated with Ural Rakhimov. The government of the Bashkortostan region controlled Bashneft until 2003. Afterwards companies affiliated with Ural Rakhimov, son of the former head of Bashkortostan Murtaza Rakhimov, acquired a major stake in Bashneft. privatized in 2009 by Sistema. Rakhimov and Sitema CEO billionaire Vladimir Yevtushenkov were implicated in the sale of Bashneft stock in 2009. Rakhimov was charged in absentia with embezzlement and money laundering and placed on the international wanted list. In late October, the Moscow Arbitration court decided that the Bashneft stock should be returned to the government because the privatization deals that let to the company becoming the property of Ural Rakhimov were effected in violation of the law. The defendants in the case were Yevtushenkov’s Sistema, its subsidiary Sistema Invest and Bashneft.

    An individual himself/herself may file for bankruptcy, or a creditor, or an authorized body may petition for him/her to be declared bankrupt. It is mandatory to introduce the procedure for restructuring an individual’s debt if a court recognizes the application for declaring an individual bankrupt as justified. The court imposes the procedure for disposing of an individual’s property if such an individual has been declared bankrupt (for example, if the plan for restructuring the individual’s debt was not submitted within the prescribed period or it was not approved by the creditor’s meeting). The court may also temporarily restrict the right of the bankrupt individual to leave the Russian Federation. Further to a creditor’s application, a lawsuit concerning bankruptcy of an individual may be initiated if the following three conditions are met at the same time: - the claimed amount is no less that RUB 500 000 and it has been in arrears for three months; - as a general rule, a claim must be supported by a court decision, unless such claim (i) is based on loan agreements or notarized transactions, (ii) is confirmed by a notary’s writ, or (iii) the individual acknowledges such claim but does not repay the relevant amount; - the creditor has deposited with the court an amount to be paid as a compensation to the financial manager (RUB 10 000). The claims raised by the creditors of the individual who has been held bankrupt are satisfied out of the debtor’s entire property, including his share in common property, except for the property on which execution can not be levied pursuant to the civil legislation. Creditors’ claims that are not satisfied due to a shortage of auctioned assets would be considered redeemed. Upon the end of settlements with creditors, bankrupt individuals would be released from any subsequent liability except for a number of instances. For example, if it has been proved that the individual acted unlawfully when the obligation arose or was performed. Such unlawful acts include committing a fraud or actions aimed at fraudulently evading the settlement of amounts the individual owes to creditors, or concealing or intentionally destroying property. The law foresees certain implications of recovery procedures being implemented in relation to an individual debtor: - while the plan for restructuring is being implemented and within five years after this plan has been implemented an individual may not conceal that he or she implemented the plan. - within five years after an individual is held bankrupt he or she may not assume any obligations in relation to facility and/or loan agreements without specifying that he or she was a bankrupt. - a bankrupt individual may not for three years after the date when he/she is held bankrupt hold positions in the management bodies of a legal entity or take part in managing a legal entity in any other way.

    Pursuant to the commission’s statement the aim of the bill is to support Russian producers and to stimulate import substitution. The bill bans the signing of state contracts with companies that are registered in the countries and jurisdictions that are on the list of offshore areas. Besides, under the bill the legislative commission is obliged to examine that the applicants for such contracts comply with these requirements and to refuse them if they don’t. In December 2013, President Vladimir Putin in his annual address to the Federal Assembly called for a crackdown on Russian companies that dodge taxes by registering in offshore jurisdictions.

    The company was accused of being engaged in an illegal scheme which resulted in bankruptcy of Archangel Diamond Corporation (ADC), a Canadian diamond development company. The action dates back to 2001 when it was filed in Colorado state court. For a number of years it was transferred from one court to another when it was informally stayed until early 2009, pending settlement efforts. In June 2009, ADC was held bankrupt. In November 2009, ADC inserted amendments into its complaint adding RICO and other claims. At this point the Archangel Diamond Corporation Liquidation Trust, which is the successor to the assets of ADC, pursues the action. The United States District Court for the District of Colorado took a decision by which dismissed the suit on December 18 due to lack of personal jurisdiction over OJSC Lukoil and based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens. In the ruling it is stated that “the Court finds that Lukoil has proved that the Russian courts are an adequate alternative forum, in light of Lukoil’s voluntary consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and forbearance in raising the statute of limitations as a defense in that forum”. The dispute took place in connection with an agreement ADC concluded with Arkhangelgeology (AGE), a Russian state corporation, to form a joint venture with the aim to finance exploration and development of diamond fields in Russia. AGE was privatized in December 1995 and became known as AGD. In 1996, AGD won the Diamond License and in 1996 opened a diamond pipe worth billions. ADC states that after OJSC LUKOIL took over AGD, the Russian company initiated an illegal scheme to exclude ADC out of the joint venture and diamond mining operation. “After obtaining as much investment as it could”, LUKOIL intended to “bleed ADC into bankruptcy and to cause it to lose its contractual rights and investment” . The claimant states that “as a result of this Illegal Scheme, ADC was forced into bankruptcy in 2010, and lost the value of its over $30 million investment as well as over $400 million in profits which it would earn through its 40% share of the joint venture, plus up to $800 million in lost profits which may be received by other diamond pipes potentially located within the scope of the Diamond License”.

    The government has reportedly asked Gazprom, Rosneft, Alrosa, Zarubezhneft, Kristall Production Corporation, their subsidiaries to reduce by March 1, 2015, their foreign currency reserves and to adhere a level fixed on October 1. This is to be done pursuant to a schedule set by the Central Bank and shall feed about $1 billion into the market every day. The companies on the list would have to sell nearly all their foreign currency revenues received after October 1. This would amount to approximately $40-$50 billion, most of it to be sold by Gazprom and Rosneft. Earlier Russian President said that the Central Bank and the government wouldn’t require exporters to sell foreign currency. Despite that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev reportedly signed an executive order on December 17, which prescribes the companies to sell foreign currency. Representatives of the five companies have refused to discuss this initiative. The measure comes on the heels of the recent ruble collapse, where the national currency exchange rate dropped 20% overnight after the Central Bank increased the rate to 17,5%. Over the past week the ruble regained some of the lost position. Still it is trading considerably lower. The national currency’s fall is connected with a number of economic sanctions imposed over the Ukrainian situation and the rapid drop in oil prices, which happened after OPEC members decided not to low production to halt the price drop.

A court in Moscow ruled that privatization of Bashneft was effected in violation of law. The Prosecutor General’s Office brought an action to return 71.6 percent stake in Bashneft back to the government. On October 30, 2014 the Moscow Arbitration court satisfied the claim of the Prosecutor General’s Office. Rakhimov and billionaire Vladimir Yevtushenkov were implicated in the sale of Bashneft stock in 2009. Rakhimov was charged in absentia with embezzlement and money laundering, put on the international wanted list. Yevtushenkov, the Sistema board chairman, was placed under house arrest as well. On December 17, Yevtushenkov was released after he pledged to appear before a court if he is summoned.

    The State Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, has adopted in the second and third readings a bill enlarging deposit insurance from 700,000 to 1.4 million rubles. Respective amendments have been inserted to the law on insuring private individuals’ deposits with banks in Russia and to the law on the Central Bank of Russia. Earlier the lower house passed in the final readings several amendments aimed at stabilizing the Russian banking system. Pursuant to them, up to 10 percent of the National Wealth Fund can be invested in the deposits or securities of banks with capital not less than 100 billion rubles ($1.7bln). The national Deposit Insurance Agency will be allocated about 1 trillion rubles ($16.8bln) for increasing the authorized capital of strategic banks. The Finance Ministry supposes this will be enough to boost the capital of the national banking sector by 13 percent. Funds will be primarily provided to strategic banks. Earlier Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, reported an outflow of funds from deposits made by individuals due to the rapid depreciation of the ruble. On Friday, Sberbank announced that this trend has receded.

    Russia according to Justice Minister Alexander Konovalov may accept the decision of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ordering it to pay damages about 1.9 billion euros to Yukos shareholders. “The judges rendered a judgment. We have to take it into consideration. We believe that it is ungrounded, but there is nothing we can do,” Konovalov said. At the same time he stressed that the decisions of the ECHR are not binding. “It depends on the goodwill of a Council of Europe member state,” Konovalov said. Still he added that implementation of the decisions of the ECHR are examined by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. The ECHR rendered the judgment on July 31. Russia filed a request asking to refer the case to the Grand Chamber which was rejected on Tuesday. After the ECHR announced that the judgment had become final, Russian Ministry of Justice made a statement in which pointed out that it would act taking into consideration “the necessity to protect Russia’s sovereign interests” based on Russian law. Meanwhile, Valery Zorkin, the chairman of Russia’s Constitutional Court, said earlier that Russia was not obliged to ensure implementation of ECHR judgments in case they are inconsistent with the Constitution of the Russian Federation. Besides, he added that ruling in the Yukos case may be submitted for consideration to the Constitutional Court. Russian courts were conferred the right to bring complaints over implementation of the ECHR judgments to the Constitutional Court in the aftermath of the Markin case, according to Zorkin. Markin, a divorced father of three children, applied to the ECHR after Russian military court denied him a parental leave. The ECHR decided in October 2010 that Markin’s rights had been infringed. The ruling became final in March 2012.

    The transfer of the Trebs and Titov license to “Bashneft-Polus” was challenged earlier by shareholder Railya Inozemtseva who owns 10 shares of Bashneft. Inozemtseva claimed that there were no sufficient reasons for the transfer of licence to Bashneft-Polus as it was in violation of the tender. The claim also contained calculation of profit loss that would allegedly result from the license transfer. In the appeal, Bashneft argued that the plaintiff failed to produce any proof that her rights were violated in any way, and that she used hearsay evidence. According to Bahsneft the transition of license will not affect payment of dividend, and that the plaintiff was abusing the right of a shareholder after filing a lawsuit while owning only 10 company shares. Bashneft was granted the license to Trebs and Titov in 2011 and soon signed a contract with LUKOIL on establishing a joint venture to develop the oil fields. The license was transferred to Bashneft-Polus (25.1% owned by LUKOIL and 74.9% owned by Bashneft) on December 14, 2011. Meanwhile, Federal Agency for Subsoil Use (Rosnedra) cancelled the transfer on May 18, 2012 because the joint venture had no oil processing facilities. Bashneft-Polus, after a long dispute, returned the development license in late May. Rosnedra is a Russian federal government body, which manages the state property in the field of use of subsoil. In particular, it issues subsoil licences, controls performance of licence holders and compliance with the terms of licences and terminates rights to use subsoil. Rosnedra functions are stipulated in The Regulations On The Federal Subsoil Resources Management Agency approved by Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation # 293, dated June 17, 2004 (with amendments).

    The Supreme Commercial Court refused to submit to its presidium for review the decision to dismiss Rosgazifikatsiya’s $308 million lawsuit against Gazprom and its registrar. Fifty million shares in Gazprom, or 0.2 percent of its charter capital owned by Rosgazifikatsiya, were transferred to the Depositary-Settlement Union in the early 2000s and auctioned. Rosgazifikatsiya maintains that its management was unaware of the transaction. The plaintiff seeks to recover its losses worth 50 million Gazprom shares.

The Moscow Commercial Court rejected Rosgazifikatsiya’s lawsuit on July 27, 2011, stating that the registrar’s fault in causing the losses has not been proven.
 Moreover, the court had established the guilt of other individuals. The appeals court upheld the ruling. The company then appealed to the Supreme Commercial Court to review the decision. During the litigation, the claim amount grew from 539 million rubles ($16.4 million) in 2001 and 1.3 billion rubles ($39.6 million) in 2008 to 10 billion rubles ($308 million).

Russian tax authorities charged the Strategy humanitarian and political science center in St. Petersburg 4.5 million rubles ($152,000) in supplementary profit tax. The center contested the decision in court. Its statement of claim reads that the tax authority sought profit tax on donations granted by foreign entities not included in a special government list. The Supreme Arbitration Court ruled that Russian non-profit entities are not obliged to pay profit tax on donations from abroad. The St. Petersburg and Leningrad Region Commercial Court referred to this decision to overrule the unlawful profit tax collection.

The Constitutional Court stated on Tuesday it is necessary to officially publish temporary international treaties before they come into effect, the court materials read. The court was checking the constitutionality of Item 1, Article 23 of the federal law “On International Treaties of the Russian Federation” pursuant to which international treaties may be applied before they come into effect. And the law provides for the official publication of only those agreements which came into effect. The case was initiated upon the complaint by Igor Ushakov, who brought a number of goods for personal use from China and paid all necessary customs duties in July 2010. It was eventually revealed that customs officers did not take into account the provisions of the Customs Unions Customs Code subject to be applied as well as the import and export agreement between the union members. The document was temporarily applied since July 1, 2010, and stipulated higher customs rates. Eventually, a recalculation was made, which served as a basis for referring to the court. The court held for the customs service’s claim to recover arrears and penalties for the delayed payment. According to the applicant, the rule in dispute does not allow the individuals concerned to timely familiarize themselves with international agreements and follow them. The Constitutional Court established that the disputed rule requires official publication of temporarily applied international treaties.

Earlier, the watchdog’s commission found the railway monopoly had violated the law On the Protection of Competition. West Siberian Railway, a subsidiary of Russian Railways, published a telegram prohibiting the loading of any goods in gondola cars apart from coal for housing and utilities and energy companies. The commission ordered Russian Railways to stop violating the antimonopoly legislation. In particular, the company must prepare and submit to the organizations involved clarifications on the inadmissibility of imposing bans and restrictions on the rail transport of goods on grounds not stipulated by the current legislation.

 The Moscow Commercial Court held against Nestle in December 2011. The company then challenged the decision. Nestle believes that Unilever’s “No magic!” advertising slogan discredits the products manufactured by Nestle under the Maggi brand, since Maggi and “magiya” (“magic” in Russian) sound similarly. Nestle maintains that Unilever’s ad is an act of unfair competition affecting Nestle’s business reputation. The company has asked the court to prohibit Unilever from distributing the mentioned advertisement. Unilever is one of the world’s leading consumer goods manufacturers. The company has been operating in Russia since 1992. It sells goods to over 160 countries. The company invested a total of 600 million euro into the Russian economy. The Nestle SA concern was established in 1866 by Swiss pharmacist Henri Nestle. Nestle owns 456 factories in 84 countries.

    A pretrial session was to be held on Monday, but the insurer fully accepted the bank’s claims. The parties did not object to hearing the case on its merits and the judge passed the award. Both the plaintiff and the defendant declined to comment on the dispute. The court is in the middle of considering two more Bank of Moscow lawsuits against the insurer: for 1.418 billion rubles ($48.4 million) and for 1.16 billion rubles ($39.6 million). Strakhovaya Gruppa is a major shareholder of Stolichnaya Strakhovaya Gruppa, holding a 50 percent minus one share stake. Stolichnaya Strakhovaya Gruppa manages an insurance holding that includes Strakhovaya Gruppa MSK, the Moscow Reinsurance Company and MSK- Life. The Bank of Moscow is restructuring its finances with the assistance of the Deposit Insurance Agency and the VTB Group, which holds a 94.8-percent interest in the bank. An inspection initiated by VTB, the bank’s new shareholder, uncovered bad loans in its credit portfolio. The Deposit Insurance Agency allocated a 295 billion ruble ($10 million) loan to the bank at the expense of Central Bank reserves. The loan was granted for 10 years at a discounted rate. The loan was then invested in federal loan bonds, which helped to close the gap in the banks finances. In December, VTB raised its share in the Bank of Moscow from 80.57 to 92.22 percent by acquiring shares from Strakhovaya Gruppa MSK

    The Moscow Arbitration Court has registered the antimonopoly service’s appeal against the court’s dismissal of its decision declaring Gazprom in breach of competition law while holding the bidding for bond placement contracts. The court held for Gazprom in January. The antimonopoly service challenged the judgment. The Federal Antimonopoly Service declared in September 2011 that Gazprom violated competition law during an open bidding for contracts on its bonds placement. Gazprom summed up the bidding results in April 2010. Renaissance Capital and Gazprombank were granted the mandate to place its bonds amounting to 300 billion rubles ($9.6 billion), which at the time was the largest borrowing program on the Russian market. The antitrust authority has established that Gazprom unlawfully overstated the importance of an aspect of the bids appraisal, thus giving preference to an inferior bid. Gazprom responded that competition law is inapplicable in the case as it never announced that the funds raised from the bond placement would be allocated for gas transfer-related activities. In this regard, the gas monopoly was entitled to determine the bid conditions at its own discretion rather than to strictly follow tender regulations and competition law norms. The Federal Antimonopoly Service said Gazprom referred to the mentioned legislation in its tender documents and must follow them to respect the rights of all bidders. The Service also admitted that it would not have sued Gazprom if not for these references. MICEX registered the Gazprom bonds placement in August 2011. Gazprom’s board of directors decided to issue 300 billion rubles ($9.6 billion) in three-year bonds at a par value of 1,000 rubles. The bonds were to be issued in a public offering at MICEX Stock Exchange. Gazprom’s charter capital is 118.368 billion rubles ($3.8 billion), divided into 23.674 billion common shares with a par value of five rubles. Over 50 percent of Gazprom’s shares are held by the state.

    A commercial court of Krasnoyarsk will hear on March 21 the Interregional Distributive Grid Company of Siberia’s (IDGC of Siberia) lawsuit against Rusal Krasnoyarsk Aluminum Smelter for $23.53 million, according to the court materials. IDGC of Siberia intends to recover through the commercial court 689.642 million rubles ($23.53 million) in unjust enrichment for electricity provided in January 2012 and interest for using someone elses funds amounting to 1.529 million rubles ($52,190), the court materials read. The lawsuit was submitted to the court on March. IDGC of Siberia has not yet commented on the situation. It was reported earlier that in 2010 the Ninth Commercial Court of Appeals obligated Federal Grid Company of Unified Energy System (FGC UES) to conclude a contract with Krasnoyarsk Aluminum Smelter on the provision of electricity from January 1, 2010. The court confirmed that FGC UES, rather than IDGC of Siberia, started providing electricity to the smelter in early 2010. In September 2009, Rusal Aluminum Business Director Alexei Arnautov said the smelter will pay FGC UES for the electricity consumed, omitting IDGC Siberias mediation services. IDGC is engaged in network power transmission across Russia and services an area of 1.856 million square kilometers.

    The Moscow Arbitration Court postponed on Monday until April 1 its hearing of the Luxemburg-based Yukos Capital S.a.r.l.s $383 million lawsuit against Yuganskneftegaz. The lawsuit was filed by the Vesta investment company, a Rosneft shareholder. According to Vesta, the loans in dispute were issued to Yuganskneftegaz in breach of law. The contracts were signed in July-August 2004 and set to be fulfilled in 2007. The lawsuit was submitted against Yukos Capital S.a.r.l. and Rosneft, which later took over a former YUKOS subsidiary Yuganskneftegaz. The lawsuit was submitted in 2007, but its consideration was suspended until the end of the criminal case against former YUKOS head Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his business partner Platon Lebedev. In late 2010, a Moscow district court sentenced both men to 14 years in prison for oil theft and money laundering. They were expected to be released in 2017, taking into account the time they had already served for their convictions from their first trial in 2005. However, on May 24, the Moscow City Court reduced their sentences by one year. Now they may be released in 2016.

    The Russian government plans to amend regulations concerning airports service providers. Antimonopoly measures are aimed to prevent the monopolization of ground operations charges at Russian airports. It is observed that end consumers pay substantial charges that are higher in Moscow than elsewhere.  The interests of business aviation in Russia are lobbied by the Russian United Business Aviation Association and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. Its officials press towards the creation in Russian a US-style system, where all airports shall have competition for airport services.

    A former minority shareholder of Yukos initiated a suit against the Russian state. The Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, decided that State actions caused the bankruptcy of the petroleum company. The Arbitration Court ruled for the Yukos shareholders and for the recovery of $3,5 million USD in damages from the State. The Agreement between the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (London, April 6, 1989) was the legal foundation of this decision. The USSR ratified this Agreement by the Ordinance of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of May 29, 1991 N 2199-I. The Agreement prescribes that disputes unresolved amicably shall be submitted to international arbitration, if either party of the dispute wants it.

Therefore, any investor involved in the dispute can submit the case to the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (art. 8 of the Agreement). However, Russia’s position was based on the contestation of jurisdiction of the arbitration under the provisions of the Agreement. The decision was delivered on September 17, 2010 by the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce in favor of RosinvestCo UK Ltd. It has been confirmed by its attorneys and the representative of the Ministry of Finance. RosinvestCo is affiliated with the American hedge-fund Elliott Associates with assets of $17 billion. Since 2007 British investors first sought to recover $75 million, and later claimed more than $200 million, owing to the investment losses after the bankruptcy of Yukos. Russia tried to contest the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce in Sweden’s state courts assuming that the arbitrators could only decide the questions about the procedure for, and amount of, compensation, but not the question of its origin. The Supreme Court of Sweden finally dismissed this appeal on November 12.

The eurobonds’ prospectus of November 29, prepared by the Russian Ministry of Finance, mentions this decision against Russia. According to the representative of the Russian Ministry of Finance, the arbitration decision was appealed in the Court of Appeal in Stockholm on December 10. Russia’s legal position is based on the fact that the arbitrators exceeded their powers, because they could not examine the tax issues of Yukos in Russia. In addition, the arbitrators committed a procedural mistake, having imposed the burden of proof on the Russian Federation. Despite a significant reduction in compensation, Russia continues to dispute the decision, because it is of the precedential nature of the disputes on investment protection agreements. The same Arbitration Institute in Stockholm is now considering a lawsuit by seven Spanish investment funds – holders of Yukos’ American Depositary Receipts, whose interests are represented by Renta 4 S.V.S.A. (the total amount of stated claims is not disclosed).
