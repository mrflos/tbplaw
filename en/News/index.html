<p>An individual himself/herself may file for bankruptcy, or a creditor, or an authorized body may petition for him/her to be declared bankrupt. It is mandatory to introduce the procedure for restructuring an individual’s debt if a court recognizes the application for declaring an individual bankrupt as justified. The court imposes the procedure for disposing of an individual’s property if such an individual has been declared bankrupt (for example, if the plan for restructuring the individual’s debt was not submitted within the prescribed period or it was not approved by the creditor’s meeting). The court may also temporarily restrict the right of the bankrupt individual to leave the Russian Federation.  <a href="https://tbplaw.com/en/News/Russian_President_signed_a_bill_on_personal_bankruptcy_which_enacts_rehabilitation_procedures_for_debtors" title="Russian President signed a bill on personal bankruptcy which enacts rehabilitation procedures for debtors">»&gt;</a></p>

<p>As of December 26, the oil-to-telecoms conglomerate Sistema has filed an action  against Ural Invest, a company associated with Ural Rakhimov. It seeks compensation from Bashneft’s previous owners for the damages it allegedly incurred due to the confiscation of its stake in the oil company. The action was brought to Moscow Arbitration court after the court’s decision to restore state ownership in Bashneft shares entered into force.  <a href="https://tbplaw.com/en/News/Russian_businessman_Ural_Rakhimov_supposes_that_the_claim_asserted_by_AFK_Sistema_seeking_70_7_billion_rubles_(_1_3_billion)_in_damages_over_Bashneft_" title="Russian businessman Ural Rakhimov supposes that the claim asserted by AFK Sistema seeking 70.7 billion rubles ($1.3 billion) in damages over Bashneft oil company is ungrounded ">»&gt;</a></p>

<p>Ural-Invest controlled by former Bashneft CEO Ural Rakhimov is specified as a defendant in the action. The government of the Bashkortostan region controlled Bashneft until 2003. Afterwards companies affiliated with Ural Rakhimov, son of the former head of Bashkortostan Murtaza Rakhimov, acquired  a major stake in Bashneft. The company was privatized in 2009 when Russian oil-to-telecoms conglomerate AFK Sistema acquired control of it.  <a href="https://tbplaw.com/en/News/AFK_Sistema_holding_company_has_asserted_a_claim_to_Moscow_Arbitration_court_asking_damages_about_70_7_billion_rubles_for_forfeiture_of_Bashneft_share" title="AFK Sistema holding company has asserted a claim to Moscow Arbitration court asking damages about 70.7 billion rubles for forfeiture of Bashneft shares">»&gt;</a></p>

<p> The company was accused of being engaged in an illegal scheme which resulted in bankruptcy of Archangel Diamond Corporation (ADC), a Canadian diamond development company. The action dates back to 2001 when it was filed in Colorado state court. For a number of years it was transferred from one court to another when it was informally stayed until early 2009, pending settlement efforts. <a href="https://tbplaw.com/en/News/Russia’s_oil_producer_OJSC_Lukoil_won_the_dismissal_of_a_long-running_action" title="Russia’s oil producer OJSC Lukoil won the dismissal of a long-running action">»&gt;</a></p>

<p>The government has reportedly asked Gazprom, Rosneft, Alrosa, Zarubezhneft, Kristall Production Corporation, their subsidiaries to reduce by March 1, 2015, their foreign currency reserves and to adhere a level fixed on October 1. This is to be done pursuant to a schedule set by the Central Bank and shall feed about $1 billion into the market every day. The companies on the list would have to sell nearly all their foreign currency revenues received after October 1. This would amount to approximately $40-$50 billion, most of it to be sold by Gazprom and Rosneft. <a href="https://tbplaw.com/en/News/Five_major_Russian_state-owned_companies_engaged_in_export_operations_will_be_required_to_sell_foreign_currency_in_the_next_two_months" title="Five major Russian state-owned companies engaged in export operations will be required to sell foreign currency in the next two months">»&gt;</a>
