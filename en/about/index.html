    <div class="post-content">
      <p><strong>Timofeev, Vahrenwald &amp; Partners</strong> is a full-service <strong>Moscow law firm</strong>. Our attorneys are admitted to practice law in the Russian Federation, and speak <strong>Russian, English, French, German, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and Italian</strong>.</p>

<p>TV&amp;P law firm guarantees the high-quality legal skills that clients demand from large, multinational law firms, but with the <strong>personal attention, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness</strong> of a smaller, more intimate, law firm. The lawyers at TV&amp;P are all members of the Moscow Bar and some of them, members of foreign Bars. Contrary to the current trend, TV&amp;P has chosen to remain independent, and to preserve a concentrated and accessible structure, with a view to provide its clients and partners <strong>with an efficient, personalised and trustworthy service</strong>. Meanwhile, TV&amp;P <strong>has developed solid and privileged relations with an important number of law firms abroad</strong>.</p>

<p>TV&amp;P provides its clients with useful legal advice on all their commercial projects, the negotiating and drafting of their contracts, their relations with their employees or sub-contractors, and, if required, protects their interests before the Courts.</p>

<p><strong>Our legal representation is founded upon solid experience in our areas of practice</strong> (lawyers successfully participated in a variety of projects, including $US 120 million debt recovery in LCIA, legal support for LNG supplies from Russia to USA by sea; bankruptcy of $US 40 million plant; legal support for the operations of medium-sized Russian oil and gas companies; legal counsel to a major South Korean investment fund on various aspects of operations in the Russian market, etc.).</p>

<p>Our lawyers provide <strong>affordable, quality legal services</strong> and personal attention <strong>to small and large businesses</strong>. We invite you to contact us by telephone or e-mail to get more information about our lawyers and practice areas. TV&amp;P also provides <strong>legal advice</strong> and services for our individual clients in their day-to-day affairs.</p>

<p>We believe in an old-school concept of legal service, treating each client’s legal issues, whether business or personal, as central to that client’s well being and requiring the full attention of a partner. Our attorneys exercise the highest level of judgment, discretion and integrity in resolving client matters, regardless of the issue. <strong>We may rely on strengths of our legal experts</strong>. Among them well-known Russian lawyers, involved in law-making process and administration of justice, professors at world-renowned Russian universities (Moscow State Lomonosov University, Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Institute of State and Law of the Academy of Sciences of the Russian Federation).</p>

<p>We routinely confer with our clients at every stage of the legal process and believe that regular contact with our clients is a vital part of our responsibility to them. We are able negotiators and business advisors, but when necessary, we fight zealously and aggressively on our clients’ behalf.</p>

<p>We recognize that the cost of legal representation can inhibit a client’s ability to pursue his or her rights; accordingly, we are dedicated to <strong>finding</strong> innovative, <strong>cost-effective solutions</strong> to complex problems.</p>
